# What? Why?

I got my hands on a RG350M - a portable, MIPS32, Linux based handheld portable using the
[OpenDingux](https://wiki.dingoonity.org/index.php?title=OpenDingux:About) distribution - for
the purpouse of low-spec handheld Rust game development without signing a bunch of NDAs.

# Quick Start

1. Install [rustup](https://rustup.rs/) on Linux (Windows WSL OK)
2. Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Open this directory in VS Code
4. Optionally install workspace recommended VS Code extensions
5. Run the `default` build task (`Ctrl`+`Shift`+`B`)
6. ???
7. Profit

TODO:

- [ ] Create basic GL clear color demo
- [ ] Script creation of squashfs
- [ ] Test deploy instructions in lieu of 6/7
